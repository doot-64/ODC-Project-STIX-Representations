# Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity project: STIX Representations
For the 2023/2024 Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity course at Politecnico di Milano, I represented four real-world cybersecurity events using the [STIX 2.1 language](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro).
The process was aided by the STIX python library.
