- the Internet Explorer infrastructure entity could be an identity
- the mail that some of the maliocious domains are registered to could possibly be an infrastructure
- the hashes observed from the common signatures were labeled as indicators but could possibly be just observed entities since the associated samples are described as "potentially related".
    Although, they're still related to some malicious domains, so I'd consider them indicators.
